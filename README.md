# Text-clustering
I used Kmeans clustering as it helps to cluster unstructured data.
I also created a Named Entity Recognition model to detect entities in a given text.
A report for the work done is attached.
Here is a link for the d3 visualisation of the created clusters. [link] ("https://ms-ainebyona.github.io/d3-visual-for-clusters/")
